Hi - this file contains a brief introduction about what the rest of this 
repository contains and the reasoning for the contents.


This repository contains the .html documents and images,
and properly created parent-child file system of these assets in the premise
of practice and real-world use of introductory HTML elements to create a multi-
page website for different food recipes - all in line with the Project: Recipes
sub-section of The Odin Project's Foundations course.

I will use basic HTML elements to create this website while trying to make a
proper parent-child filesystem to demonstrate to myself how to 
deploy textbook organizational techniques and the proper form and function 
of a .html document, boilerplate, and the contents of said document,
 as well as proper references between documents with anchor elements 
and the sourcing of image elements.

The aim is to demonstrate, first and foremost, and to myself, how to create
proper .html documents with textbook boilerplates and the rudimentary core contents
that allow its functioning, in order to create a multipage website with individual, but linked, web pages - with the context of a recipe website with individual recipes in their own specific web pages.
Ok, here goes.

DISCLAIMER:
Images sourced are not mine and used from other websites - 
sourced from results on Google Images, and from AllRecipes, where the basic .html documents in links referred to in the index.html file draws their recipes from. The recipes created are also not mine, and derived from AllRecipes. Credits for the recipes in steps and ingredients, and some images used in the web pages, go to the original users that created the recipes
on said AllRecipes, and to AllRecipes themselves for some of the media provided.
